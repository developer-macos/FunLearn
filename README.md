# FunLearn — HTML/CSS/JS the funny way

A tiny multi‑page site you can deploy anywhere. No frameworks, just semantic HTML, modern CSS and vanilla JS.

**Pages**
- `index.html` — landing page with features, testimonials, FAQ
- `lessons.html` — curriculum overview
- `playground.html` — live code editor + preview
- `pricing.html` — pricing plans
- `about.html` — about the company
- `contact.html` — contact form (client-side demo only)

**How to use**
Open `index.html` in a browser, or serve the folder with any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).
